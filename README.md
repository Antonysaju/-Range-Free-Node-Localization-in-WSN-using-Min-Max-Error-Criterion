# -Range-Free-Node-Localization-in-WSN-using-Min-Max-Error-Criterion
A Python-based simulation that estimates unknown sensor node positions in Wireless Sensor Networks without GPS. Uses a range-free Min–Max Error Criterion with anchor connectivity, error analysis, and real-time mobility visualization for WSN and IoT scenarios.
